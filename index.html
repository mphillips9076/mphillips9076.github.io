          <h2>Why have Greek and Roman myth continuously dominated pop culture?</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Myths have constantly circulated in pop culture, whether it be Shakespeare's allusions in his plays, or Rick Riordan's <i/>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i>. In this article, I take a look at <a href="https://medium.com/@mphil0214/why-have-greek-and-roman-myth-continuously-dominated-pop-culture-781f6a0ba9e8">why and how</a> ancient mythology has cropped up and what that means for us as a society.

          <h2>Swatting and Its Major Impacts</h2>
          <p class="description">
            The dawn of the internet has spelled increasing desensitization for us as a society. This apathy combined with the anonymity of the internet has led to a very serious online behavior called "swatting," wherein a "swatter" calls in a SWAT team against others in order to harass them. In this podcast, my classmates and I discuss swatting, its impact in the U.S., and how it has progressed over the past few years.</a>

          <h2>Trying to Make an Ancient Roman Omelet as a College Student</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Preserving historical and cultural traditions is vital to preserving our understanding of humanity as a whole -- but you don't have to be a historian to do so, nor do you have to be a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/heritage-appalachian-apples"> major enthusiast</a>! In this video, I try my best to make a cheap and quick ancient Roman omelet while talking about how change can be a good thing for the preservation of traditions.

          <h2>Save Ancient Studies Alliance</h2>
          <p class="description">
            As a Classics student, I naturally believe that all people should have the opportunity to learn about the rich and diverse history of the Ancient Mediterranean. The <a href="https://www.saveancientstudies.org/">Save Ancient Studies Alliance</a> also believes in this mission, seeking to increase accessibility and exposure to the ancient world as well as to rethink how the ancient world is studied.
